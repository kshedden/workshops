    "**Background:** The function _gen_study_dat_ below simulates data from multiple independent two-arm studies.  You do not need to understand the internals of this function, but we will use it below to simulate data.  Though this function, we are able to specify the number of studies (n_study), the population effect size (pes), and some parameters that control how the per-arm sample sizes are generated (arm_size_mean, arm_size_cv, and arm_size_cor).  Finally, var_cv controls how the variances of the data in each study are simulated.  The average data variance is 1, but different studies have different variances and the [coefficient of variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation) of these variances is given by var_cv."
