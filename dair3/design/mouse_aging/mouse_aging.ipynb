    "# Longevity phenotypes in mice of various ages\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we consider a [mouse study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34515-y) that examines how phenotypes change as mice age. The work was authored by Xie et al., and was published in Nature Communications in 2022.  This is a large and complex study and we will only consider a few aspects of it here.  Our focus in this notebook is on the study design and analysis plan, which includes many of the issues covered [here](https://github.com/kshedden/workshops/blob/main/dair3/design/design.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep this discussion accessible we will not be using advanced statistical methods, although there is plenty of opportunity to do so.  Also, we will not be discussing implementation details of the code provided below, since our focus is on concepts related to rigorous study design and reproducible analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The study data are available [here](https://data.mendeley.com/preview/ypz9zyc9rp?a=09b16f74-4581-48f7-94af-469e01757949), but you do not need to download the data directly from this link, as the script below will read a prepared version of the data from [Github](https://github.com/kshedden/workshops/tree/main/dair3/design/mouse_data).  If you are curious about how the data were prepared, see the [pool.py](https://github.com/kshedden/workshops/blob/main/dair3/design/mouse_data/pool.py) script, but you do not need to do this to work with the code in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching aim of this study is to understand how phenotypes change with age in mice, either naturalistically or following an intervention.  These are referred to as _age specific phenotypes_, or \"ASPs\".  The authors claim to perform \"deep phenotyping\", by which they mean that a large number (around two-hundred) phenotypes are assessed. This is an open-ended exploratory study that does not test a specific pre-specified hypothesis.  The researchers considered all phenotypes in an \"unbiased\" manner for changes over the mouse lifespan, and in response to intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study has an [observational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study) component in which changes in some phenotypes occur naturalistically over the mouse lifespan.  It also includes an interventional component with three independent interventions: two genetic manipulations and a dietary intervention (intermittent fasting).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors used both univariate and multivariate methods in their study.  In univariate analyses, a single phenotype was considered in relation to age, and (if present) intervention group assignment.  Below, we aim to replicate a subset of the univariate analyses (both observational and interventional).  We do not further consider the multivariate analyses here, since these require more advanced statistical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study design and analytic methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This study considers phenotypic change over the mouse lifespan. Since some of the phenotypes of interest can only be assessed after sacrificing the mouse, it is implemented as a [cross sectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study) rather than a [longitudinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study) study.  In the observational component of the study, the authors collected data at 6 distinct ages during the mouse lifespan (from 3-26 months), with around 15 independent mice assessed at each age. In the interventional component of the study, only two time points were considered.  In both cases, mice observed at different ages are mutually independent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors emphasize that at the first age (3 months) the mice are considered to be very young, and are not yet subject to any aging effects.  The effect of an intervention can be limited to the older ages, or alternatively can affect mice at all ages roughly equally.  Although both effects are interesting, the authors argue that the interventions that specifically impact older mice are more likely to translate to human therapies, or to reveal important mechanisms underlying aging.\n",
    "\n",
    "All mice in this study are male.  Current NIH guidance strongly advocates for sex balanced designs (this study was conducted in Europe).\n",
    "\n",
    "A large number of phenotypes are measured.  Some, such as heart rate, can be measured on a living mouse, while others such as organ weights can only be made upon sacrifice of the animal -- this is why the design is cross sectional rather than longitudinal (i.e. by making repeated measures on the same mice).  Some components of the study involved an intervention, such as mutation of a gene or dietary modifications.  Other components of the study are observational, considering changes in a phenotype such as heart rate in unperturbed mice of various ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors make a number of comments about their study design choices in the Discussion section of their paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important practical consideration is whether the phenotypes approximately change linearly over time, or if the phenotype changes are more complex than can be described in linear form.  These two patterns of effects can be distinguished by considering models that are either additive, or that include a time by intervention group interaction."

Both Z-scores and standardized effects are dimension-free.  Standardized effects are a measure of the [size of an effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size), not its statistical significance.  In order to convey information about statistical significance in these plots, we also include 95% [confidence intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) (adjusted for multiple comparisons) for each standardized effect.
